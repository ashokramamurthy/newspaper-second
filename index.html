                It is gathered from reliable sources that officials have recommended easing restrictions in districts especially since Covid-19 cases are steadily coming down. 
     The officials had also suggested intensifying the lockdown in western districts as the number of cases is high in that region. <br> <br>
    
    As such, it is reasonably expected that some relaxations may be announced with the reduction trend in the spread of the resurgent coronavirus pandemic.
